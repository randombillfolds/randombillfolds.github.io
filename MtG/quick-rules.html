                <b>800.4a</b>
                When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and
                <u>any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end</u>
                . Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist.
                <u>Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled</u>
                . This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.

              <b>603.4.</b> A triggered ability may read "When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect]." When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn't true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the "intervening 'if' clause" rule. (The word "if" has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an "if" that immediately follows a trigger condition.)

          This means that a triggered ability cannot satisfy the conditions of another ability with the same trigger event.

        <p class="card-text">
          e.g., <b><auto-card>Regna, the Redeemer</auto-card> Ruling</b>
          If your team didn’t gain life during the turn before the end step begins, Regna’s last ability won’t trigger at all. Gaining life during the end step won’t cause the ability to trigger.

            <h5 class="card-title">Does ETBing attacking induce on-attack triggers?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              No. Although the creature you put onto the battlefield is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Any effects that say that the new creature can’t attack (such as that of <span class="badge badge-primary"><auto-card>Propaganda</auto-card></span>, or if you get a creature with defender) affect only the declaration of attackers. They won’t stop the creature you find from entering the battlefield attacking.
